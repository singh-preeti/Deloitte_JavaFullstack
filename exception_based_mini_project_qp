Menu-Driven E-Commerce Application Using Java
Problem Statement

Design and implement a menu-driven Java-based E-Commerce Application that simulates an online shopping system. The application should allow a customer to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and complete a purchase while handling all possible runtime errors using exception handling.

System Requirements
1. Product Management

Create a Product class with the following attributes:

productId

productName

price

stock

Provide methods to:

Display product details

Update product stock after purchase

2. Customer Management

Create a Customer class with:

customerId

name

balance

Provide methods to:

Display customer details

Deduct balance after successful payment

3. Shopping Cart

Implement a cart system that allows:

Adding products to the cart

Calculating the total cart value

Ensure that products cannot be added if the stock is insufficient.

4. Custom Exception Handling

Create a custom checked exception:

InsufficientBalanceException

Throw this exception when the customer’s balance is less than the total cart amount.

Use built-in exceptions to handle:

Out-of-stock products

Invalid menu choices

Invalid quantity inputs

5. Menu-Driven Operations

Display the following menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit:

========= E-COMMERCE MENU =========
1. View Available Products
2. View Customer Details
3. Add Product to Cart
4. View Cart
5. Make Payment
6. Exit
==================================
6. Payment Processing

Implement payment using try-catch-finally

On successful payment:

Deduct customer balance

Reduce product stock

Display Order Confirmation Message

On failure:

Display meaningful error messages such as:

“Product out of stock”

“Insufficient balance to complete payment”

“Invalid input, please try again”

7. Program Termination

Ensure:

Proper resource handling

Graceful program termination without runtime errors

Exit message when the user selects Exit

Expected Output

Clear menu display

Proper validation messages

Order confirmation on successful purchase

Error messages for failed transactions

Continuous execution until user chooses to exit

Learning Objectives

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Exception handling (checked & unchecked)

Custom exceptions

Menu-driven program design

Real-world application simulation
